## Description of the Project

Every year about 40 million tons of food in the United States ends up in landfills. This equates to approximately 40% of the entire US food supply ([source](https://www.rts.com/resources/guides/food-waste-america/)). Restaurants and other food businesses are big contributors to these numbers as, at the end of the day, there is bound to be leftover food that inevitably goes to waste. <br/>

Therefore, this project is built to be an extensive and dynamic marketplace with restaurants, bakeries, cafes and other businesses in the food industry. It serves to any food suppliers and to anyone else with access to the internet as a consumer. It will allow for food business to log any food items that are available with them, and would rather go to waste, to be viewed by the general population that could potentially consume it to reduce wastage.<br/>

## History of the Project & How to Contribute

### History

As study away students on a tight budget, we have to manage our budgets very carefully. On top of that, we watched two instances of food wastage unfold infront of us which made us want to develop an application which could benefit everyone simultaneously. <br/>

In only our first week in New York, as we embarked on our search for Halal Food, we came across a restaurant called Holy Cow. As we finished up our meal, the restaurant owner reached out to us with an offer to take 3 burgers, if we wish to, for free. Upon inquiry, since the free offer came off as a surprise, the owner told us that someone had placed an order but they never showed up to receive it. As the food may have gone to waste otherwise, we were offered without any charge.<br/>

Only a week later after the aforementioned case, we arrived at a 7 Eleven franchise looking for Pizzas. However, we were met with another surprise as the attendee informed us that they had trashed the pizzas only a few minutes back since no came to pick them up. <br/>

At this point, we wished there was a platform that provides accessibility to the general population with an opportunity to receive and consume food that would otherwise go to waste. This would help reduce the wastage of food, as well as allow restaurants to rather sell the food for a very discounted price to cover the losses, or even give it away for free. It branches opportunities like those of immediate consumption for even shelf items that are closing to expiry. <br/>

## Instructions for Building and Testing the Project
<br>

## - Instructions on How to Set Up and Run the Front-End Project

### Step 1: Forking and Cloning

To make sure that the original copy of the project is not affected, please: <br/>

- navigate to the [project-setup-g-tech repository](https://github.com/software-students-fall2021/project-setup-g-tech) and fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right corner; <br/>
- clone your forked repository to your local computer using "git clone {HTTPS address of the repo}" <br/>

### Step 2: Install Node.js

Since React.js, the tool used in building the front-end of the project, is built to run in it, one must first [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). <br />

### Step 3: Run "npm install" inside of the front-end folder on terminal to install all dependencies written in package.json

Some dependencies used in the front-end of the project include: Boostrap for React, Material UI, Font Awesome, Axios, etc. By runing "npm install," all dependencies used in the project will be installed. <br/>

### Step 4: Create .env file
Make sure to have the necessary .env file to communicate with the back-end properly. The .env file should have the REACT_APP_URL (where the back-end is running.<br/>

### Step 5: Run "npm start" on terminal within the front-end folder to run the front-end

Run "npm start" on terminal within the front-end folder to run the front-end of the project. <br/>
<br/>

## - Instructions on How to Set Up and Run the Back-End Project

#### If you have already forked/ cloned the repository, you may skip the first 2 steps

### Step 1: Forking and Cloning

To make sure that the original copy of the project is not affected, please: <br/>

- navigate to the [project-setup-g-tech repository](https://github.com/software-students-fall2021/project-setup-g-tech) and fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right corner; <br/>
- clone your forked repository to your local computer using "git clone {HTTPS address of the repo}" <br/>

### Step 2: Install Node.js

Since Express JS is the tool used in coding the back-end of the project one must first [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/. <br />

### Step 3: Run "npm install" inside of the back-end folder on terminal to install all dependencies written in package.json

Some dependencies used in the front-end of the project include: Express.js, Mocha & Chai for unit testing, as well as Istanbul NYC. <br/>

### Step 4: Create .env file
Make sure to have the necessary .env file to communicate with the database and to verify tokens. The .env file should have DB_DOMAIN, JWT_SECRET and FRONT_PATH (which is the address on which the front-end is running).<br/>

### Step 5: Run "npm start" on terminal within the back-end folder to run the front-end

Run "npm start" on terminal within the front-end folder to run the front-end of the project. <br/>
<br/>

### **Details of deployment:**
The application has been deployed using the free version of Digital Ocean. The access to the to Digital Ocean is primarily maintained by Jingjing Liu ([heyitsjj](https://github.com/heyitsjj)), while Zunair Viqar ([Zunairviqar](https://github.com/Zunairviqar)), David Iosilevich ([DavidLevich](https://github.com/DavidLevich)), Ishmal Khalid ([ishmalkhalid](https://github.com/ishmalkhalid)), Ayesha Zafar ([AyeshaZfr](https://github.com/AyeshaZfr)), Yusra Khan ([yusra-khan](https://github.com/yusra-khan)) also are regular users on the server.

### **Steps of deployment:**
The process for deployment particulary required the usage of pm2 to initiate the running of front-end and back-end separately. In each directory, run the 'npm install command' followed by 'pm2 start npm --name {*Any Name*} -- start'. One thing to ensure is that the pm2, node and all other packages are installed on the server.

## Any Other Notes
Note: On a local machine, the front-end generally runs on the localhost port 3000, whereas the back-end is set to listen any updates on the localhost port 3001. Make sure that at least port 3001 does not have anything else running before running this project, otherwise modify the line with 'const port = 3001;' to any relevant port that you wish the back-end to run on. Additionally, the front-end should possibly be running on port:3000, otherwise it results it does not run appropriately.
