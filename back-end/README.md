## Instructions on How to Set Up and Run the Back-End Project

#### If you have already forked/ cloned the repository, you may skip the first 2 steps

### Step 1: Forking and Cloning

To make sure that the original copy of the project is not affected, please: <br/>

- navigate to the [project-setup-g-tech repository](https://github.com/software-students-fall2021/project-setup-g-tech) and fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right corner; <br/>
- clone your forked repository to your local computer using "git clone {HTTPS address of the repo}" <br/>

### Step 2: Install Node.js

Since Express JS is the tool used in coding the back-end of the project one must first [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/. <br />

### Step 3: Run "npm install" inside of the back-end folder on terminal to install all dependencies written in package.json

Some dependencies used in the front-end of the project include: Express.js, Mocha & Chai for unit testing, as well as Istanbul NYC. <br/>

### Step 4: Run "npm start" on terminal within the back-end folder to run the front-end

Run "npm start" on terminal within the front-end folder to run the front-end of the project. <br/>
<br/>

Note: On a local machine, the front-end generally runs on the localhost port 3000, whereas the back-end is set to listen any updates on the localhost port 3001. Make sure that at least port 3001 does not have anything else running before running this project, otherwise modify the line with 'const port = 3001;' to any relevant port that you wish the back-end to run on.
